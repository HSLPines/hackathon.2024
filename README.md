# Street Vendor Support System - Ambev Hackathon Project

### Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a Hackathon in collaboration with **Ambev**, aimed at improving working conditions for street vendors. Our solution focuses on creating a platform that supports vendors by enhancing their business practices, safety, and overall working environment. 

### Problem Statement

Street vendors, especially those affiliated with Ambev, often face challenges in maintaining product quality, tracking sales, managing stock, and ensuring personal safety while on the job. The lack of structured support makes it difficult for them to efficiently grow and manage their businesses.

### Objectives

Our goal is to empower street vendors with tools and insights that:
- Improve **sales management** and **stock control**.
- Offer **real-time support** for **product quality maintenance** (especially in outdoor conditions).
- Ensure **personal safety** through integrated **geolocation and alert systems**.
- Provide business insights for **maximizing revenue**.

### Solution

Our solution is a comprehensive platform that offers:

1. **Mobile Application for Vendors**:
   - A user-friendly app for sales tracking, inventory management, and receiving product quality tips.
   - Daily, weekly, and monthly reports on sales and stock status.

2. **Vendor Safety Module**:
   - Geolocation tracking with SOS alerts in case of emergencies.
   - A route planner to optimize travel and ensure safety.

3. **Customer Insights & Engagement**:

   - Incentive programs like loyalty rewards for consistent customers.

4. **Vendor Education Hub**:
